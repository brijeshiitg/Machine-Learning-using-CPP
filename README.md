## This repository presents the machine learning techniques using C++.
Following algorithms will be available in this repo:

1. Univariate Linear regression
2. Linear regression with multiple features
3. Logistic regression
4. Neural Network
so on ..

## 1. Univariate Linear regression:
This directory contains c++ implementation of linar regression with one variable.

Running instructions:
step 1: go to *Univariate Linear regression* directory and compile and run the code using following command:

        `g++ --std=c++11 *.cpp && ./a.out`
        
step 2: It will prompt you to enter length of the feature and target array. Enter the length according to your requirements.

step 3: Now it will ask you to enter individual elements of feature followed by individual elements of target array.

step 4: Now it will prompt for initial value of w and b.

step 5: It will ask learning rate.

step 6: Finally, it will ask for no. of iterations you want to train the model.

Done!!
